## ‚ùó Objectives

This web-app must accomplish the following:

- [x] Use the PostgreSQL database which stores the email and password of visitors.
- [x] Only valid email formats are allowed and it should be unique.
- [x] Use the BCrypt gem to store a secure hash password and it should be at least 6 to 36 characters long.
- [x] Show validation error messages (if any) to signing in visitors.
- [x] Create a session using CookieStore as soon as visitors sign up.
- [x] Show different homepage content for signed-in and non-signed-in visitors.
- [x] If a visitor logs in with an email that doesn't exist in the database, redirect them to the signup page.
- [x] If a visitor signs up with an email that exists in our database then redirect them to the sign-in page.
- [x] Show appropriate flash messages wherever necessary like new sign up, sign in, logout, etc.
- [x] Show visitor sign-up count for both logged out and logged in visitors.
- [x] Redirect logged-in visitor to the homepage if he tries to visit the log-in or signup page.
- [x] Build a responsive site using bootstrap.
- [x] Show logged-in visitors different ways of destroying the session.
- [x] When a visitor manually enters a URL that doesn't exist, redirect them to the homepage with a flash message informing them that the URL doesn't exist.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting up a PostgreSQL user

If you don't have a user set on postgres, here's how to set new user:

```bash
sudo -u postgres createuser -s [username]
```

To set a password for this user, log in to the PostgreSQL command line client:

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
```

Enter the following command to set the password:

```bash
\password your_password
```

Enter and confirm the password. Then exit the PostgreSQL client:

```bash
\q
```

## üìã Execution

Run the following commands to execute locally:

The following will install required version of ruby (make sure [rvm is installed](https://rvm.io/rvm/install).)

```bash
rvm use 2.7.2
```

```bash
git clone git@github.com:JuzerShakir/rails-session.git
```

```bash
cd Session-CookieStore
```

```bash
bundle install
```

```bash
rails db:setup
```

```bash
rails s
```

To see this web-app up and running without executing above commands locally,
I have deployed it on [Heroku](https://rails-session.herokuapp.com/).
